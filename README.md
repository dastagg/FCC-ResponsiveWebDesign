# Free Code Camp - Responsive Web Design

This is my code for the Free Code Camp: Responsive Web Design Certificate:

Per the website:

In this Responsive Web Design Certification, you'll learn the languages that developers use to build webpages: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) for content, and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for design.

NOTE: it seems that the coding for this is all online through the browser. I just copy/paste the code into a text file as I go along with the website.
